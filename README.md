## How it works
Using ModularJS various modules are loaded at runtime.

These modules can be divided into the following stages:

### 1. Identification
- Uses an information leakage (not vulnerability) in WebGL to detect the GPU of the victim device
- Uses the browser agent to define what browser and firmware to exploit
- Uses size and resolution constraints to detect the specific victim device
- Uses various debugging information about the hardware environment using window.performance or window.navigator
- Uses benchmarking algorithms and hashing to identify and track the victim device.

### 2. Eligibility
- Using the identification information the victim is checked against various constraints, such as whether the victim is a mobile device or a desktop.

### 3. Strategy selection
- Based on the eligibility constraints and identity the exploit strategy will be selected for the victim device and loaded.

### 4. Payload retrieval
- The strategy will load the payload(s) for the victim device, on iOS this can be for example Cydia, on desktops for example a remote administration tool.
- The payload is aligned so it can be used later when the exploit has created an executable region.

### 5. Exploitation
- The exploit is started and carefully sets up read/write primitives in the browser memory.
- Once r/w is gained an executable region is created and the payload is aligned / copied into it.
- The exploit jumps to the shellcode and starts executing it

### 6. Post-Exploitation
- Various tools and capabilities could be setup after successful completion of the exploit, such as a telnet client to gain a shell on the victim from the browser.
